TWBlue Changelog

## changes in this version

In this version of TWBlue, which is being released several months after the previous one, we focused on adding initial support for GoToSocial-type networks. GoToSocial is a server for creating decentralized networks similar to Mastodon. Its API is very similar but retains some differences. In this version, TWBlue can be used to log into GoToSocial accounts, although there will be some features, such as the Streaming API and Markdown support, that are not yet functional. Another significant addition is support for creating community timelines, which will allow you to load the local and public timeline of remote instances. This is useful if your instance does not federate directly with them, as it will allow you to see posts from other communities and interact directly with them. Finally, the translation module has been rewritten; it now supports using LibreTranslate by default and DeepL, for which an API key is required. Below is the detailed list of changes:

* Core:
    * Added Initial Support to GoToSocial. Some features are not fully implemented yet, although GoToXocial instances should be able to be used as normal sessions in TWBlue. Streaming, poll options and markdown are not supported but planned for the near future.
    * The translation module has been rewritten. Now, instead of offering translations with Google Translator, the user can choose between [LibreTranslate,](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) which requires no configuration thanks to the [instance of the NVDA Spanish community;](https://translate.nvda.es) or translate using [DeepL,](https://deepl.com) for which it is necessary to create an account on DeepL and [subscribe to a DeepL API Free plan](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021200939-DeepL-API-Free) to obtain the API key which can be used to translate up to 500000 characters every month. The API key can be entered in the global options dialog, under a new tab called translation services. When translating a text, the translation engine can be changed. When changing the translation engine, the target language must be selected again before translation takes place.
    * TWBlue should be able to switch to Windows 11 Keymap when running under Windows 11. ([#494](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/issues/494))
* Mastodon:
    * Added support for viewing communities: A community timeline is the local or public timeline of another instance. This is especially useful when the instance one is part of does not federate with other remote instances. The posts displayed are only those that are shared publicly. It is possible to interact with the posts from community timelines, but it should be noted that TWBlue will take some time to retrieve the post one wishes to interact with.
    * When viewing a post, a button displays the number of boosts and times it has been added to favorites. Clicking on that button will open a list of users who have interacted with the post. From that list, it is possible to view profiles and perform common user actions.
    * Now it is possible to mute conversations in Mastodon sessions. To do this, there is a button that can be called "Mute" or "Unmute Conversation" in the dialog to display the post. Conversations that have been muted will not generate notifications or mentions when they receive new replies. Only conversations that you are a part of can be muted.
    * Fixed an error that caused TWBlue to be unable to properly display the user action dialog from the followers or following buffer. ([#575](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/issues/575))

## changes in version 2024.01.05

* Core:
    * The TWBlue website will no longer be available on the twblue.es domain. Beginning in January 2024, TWBlue will live at https://twblue.mcvsoftware.com. Also, we will start releasing versions on [gitHub releases](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/releases) so it will be easier to track specific versions.
    * As of the first release of TWBlue in 2024, we will officially stop generating 32-bit (X86) compatible binaries due to the increasing difficulty of generating versions compatible with this architecture in modern Python.
    * TWBlue should be more reliable when checking for updates.
    * If running from source, automatic updates will not be checked as this works only for distribution. ([#540](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/540))
    * Fixed the 'report an error' item in the help menu. Now this item redirects to our gitHub issue tracker. ([#524](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/524))
* Mastodon:
    * Implemented actions for the notifications buffer on a mastodon instance. Actions can be performed from the contextual menu on every notification, or by using invisible keystrokes. ([#517](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/issues/517))
    * Implemented update profile dialog. ([#547](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/547))
    * It is possible to display an user profile from the user menu within the menu bar, or by using the invisible keystroke for user details. ([#555](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/555))
    * Added possibility to vote in polls. This is mapped to Alt+Win+Shift+V in the invisible keymaps for windows 10/11.
    * Added posts search. Take into account that Mastodon instances should be configured with full text search enabled. Search for posts only include posts the logged-in user has interacted with. ([#541](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/541))
    * Added user autocompletion settings in account settings dialog, so it is possible to ask TWBlue to scan mastodon accounts and add people from followers and following buffers. For now, user autocompletion can be used only when composing new posts or replies.
    * TWBlue should be able to ignore deleted direct messages or messages from deleted accounts. Previously, a direct message that no longer existed in the instance caused errors when loading the direct messages buffer and could potentially affect notifications as well.
    * TWBlue should be able to ignore notifications from deleted accounts or posts.

## changes in version 2023.4.13

During the development of the current TWBlue version, Twitter has cut out access from their API, meaning TWBlue will no longer be able to communicate with Twitter. This is the end of the support of TWBlue for Twitter sessions. No new sessions will be available for this social network, and we will focus in adding more features to our Mastodon support and writing support for more websites and networks. Thank you everyone who have been using TWBlue to manage your Twitter accounts since 2013.

* TWBlue should be able to display variables within templates (for example, now it is possible to send a template inside a post's text). Before, it was removing $variables so it was difficult to show how to edit templates from the client. ([#515](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/515))
* Mastodon:
    * it is possible to add descriptions for all media available on Mastodon (audio, photos, video and Givs). ([#516](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/516))
    * TWBlue can now perform OCR in attached images.
    * It is possible to add aliases to mastodon users. Also, the "manage user aliases" setting, located on the application menu within the menu bar can be used to add, edit or remove aliases.
    * Implemented "Hide emojis on usernames" in both GUI and invisible interface.
    * Added an experimental feature to recover from connection errors. When making a post, if the post cannot be published due to any kind of error, TWBlue will bring up the dialog where the post was composed, so you can give the post a second chance or save the post's text. This feature should work for threads, posts with attachments, polls and replies. ([#527,](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/527) [#526,](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/526) [#377,](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/377) [#137,](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/137) [#108](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/108))
    * When playing media items, TWBlue will prefer remote URL streams and fall back to instance cached stream URL'S.
    * Fixed an error on mentions buffer that was making TWBlue unable to load posts if there were mentions from a blocked or deleted account.
    * Fixed an error when loading timelines during startup where TWBlue was unable to change the buffer title properly.

## Changes on version 2023.2.8

This release focuses on fixing some important bugs that have been reported in the previous version. Particularly, TWBlue should be able to authorize on some instances that have blocked the Mastodon.py library, and should be able to avoid repeatedly calling some endpoints that cause excessive connections for some instances. Additionally, it is possible to disable Streaming from the account options in Mastodon. This can be especially useful if TWBlue keeps making a lot of API calls for some instances.

* Fixed the update system.
* Fixed a bug when attempting to switch between different accounts using the invisible interface, if the focused account is not an active session.
* Mastodon:
    * Improved the way TWBlue counts characters in Mastodon. Now it counts only the username part in a remote user (@domain is not counted against character limit), adds content warning text to character count, also emojis and CJK characters are counted as 1 as opposed to 2. ([#511](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/511))
    * Added notification when a user joins an instance. This notification is only available for administrators.
    * Added option to disable Streaming in the account options. This can be useful if TWBlue, for some reason, repeatedly calls the instance API.
    * Improved the code that works with the Streaming API to reduce the number of reconnection attempts TWBlue performs.
    * Fixed media uploads for audio, video and gifvs. ([#513](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/513))

## Changes in version 2023.2.3

In this version, TWBlue will no longer support Twitter sessions starting on February 9, due to Twitter's policies prohibiting third-party clients, in addition to the shutdown of the free access to the Twitter API. All Twitter sessions that are active on TWBlue will stop working as of February 9, when the free API access will finally be shut down. It will not be possible to display or add Twitter sessions from the Session manager. From the TWBlue team, we will continue working to improve our support for Mastodon instances and add other social networks in the near future. If you want to keep in touch with the project, you can follow us in our mastodon account, at [@twblue@maaw.social.](https://maaw.social/@twblue)

* In the graphical interface, TWBlue will update menu items, in the menu bar, depending on whether you are focusing a Twitter or Mastodon session. This makes it possible for TWBlue to display the correct terms in each social network. Take into account that there might be unavailable items for the currently active session.
* in the keystroke editor for the invisible interface, TWBlue displays the available shortcuts for the currently active session. Descriptions of those keystrokes are also different for Twitter and mastodon sessions to use correct terms for both networks.
* In the invisible interface, TWBlue will skip sessions that have not been started when using the keyboard shortcut to switch between different accounts.
* Fixed a bug when deleting a session in the session manager dialog. Sessions can now be deleted correctly.
* Mastodon:
    * Added basic support to notifications buffer. This buffer shows mastodon notifications in real time. Every notification is attached to a kind of object (posts, users, relationships or polls). At the moment, the only supported action for notification is dismissing, which allows you to remove the notification from the buffer (take into account, though, that mention notifications will remove also the mention in its corresponding buffer, due to the way TWBlue reads mentions from mastodon instances).
    * Fixed an issue that was preventing TWBlue to create more than one user timeline during startup.
    * Fixed getting more items in mentions buffer. ([#508](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/issues/508))
    * TWBlue will display properly new paragraphs in mastodon posts.
    * In the session manager, Mastodon sessions are now displayed including the instance to avoid confusion.
    * TWBlue will now read default visibility preferences when posting new statuses, and display sensitive content. These preferences can be set on the mastodon instance, in the account's preferences section. If you wish to change TWBlue's behavior and have it not read those preferences from your instance, but instead set the default public visibility and hide sensitive content, you can uncheck the Read preferences from instance checkbox in the account options.
    * If a mastodon instance is not active or there are errors during login, TWBlue will report it in the log file and will continue with other sessions.
    * When replying to someone in a public post, TWBlue will default to "unlisted" as its visibility setting. This is done so replies will not clutter local and federated timelines. This setting might be changed when writing the reply, though. ([#504,](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/504))
    * TWBlue uses its own user agent in Mastodon sessions, so it will be easier to identify the client for instance admins.
    * TWBlue will check if the streaming API endpoints are available before attempting to start Streaming for the current session. Before, TWBlue caused load issues in misconfigured mastodon instances where the streaming API were not available.

## Changes in version 2022.12.13

* per popular request, We will generate a 32-bit portable version of TWBlue available for Windows 7 operating systems. This version will not be supported in our automatic updater, so in case of using such version, you would need to download it manually every time there is a new update. TWBlue will continue to be available for Windows 7 as long as it is possible to build it using Python 3.7.
* Fixed a couple of bugs that were making TWBlue unable to be opened in some computers, related to our translator module and some COM objects handled incorrectly.
* Fixed an issue that was making TWBlue unable to open in certain computers due to errors related to Win32 API'S.
* Twitter:
    * Fixed a bug that was making sent direct messages to be placed in received direct messages buffer.
    * When quoting a tweet, you can use all 280 characters to send your quoted tweet, as opposed to the 256 characters TWBlue allowed before.
    * Fixed a bug that was making TWBlue unable to reply to direct messages by using the "reply" keystroke.
* Mastodon:
    * Added account settings dialog.
    * Added template editing functionality for mastodon accounts.
    * When a post is edited, TWBlue will update the post object in the buffer to reflect the latest edit.
    * Fixed a small issue that was preventing TWBlue to display some posts in their corresponding dialog.

## Changes in version 2022.12.6

Most of all changes in this release are focused on adding Mastodon support to TWBlue. The features present to handle Twitter should not have been altered in any way. We were not intended to release this version so soon, but unfortunately, Twitter started to present issues in some regions with one particular API endpoint we were using, making impossible for everyone in such regions to use the application. We will release more updates to fix any possible issue regarding Twitter API, but please take into account that this is sometimes an issue happening in Twitter's servers and while we do our best to make TWBlue work despite those problems, you might encounter glitches from time to time.

* TWBlue now builds with Python 3.10.8. ([#493](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/493))
    * This change also drops support for Windows 7.
* The TWBlue interface has not been translated yet, as we are releasing this update to fix an important Twitter issue for some regions.
* Twitter sessions should be able to be opened properly again in TWBlue, in regions where it didn't work since last week.
* It is now possible to log in to instances of mastodon, hometown and similar software (Pleroma should work as well, although it has not been tested at this time). From the session manager, clicking on the “new account” button will bring up a menu from which you can select whether you want to log in to Twitter or Mastodon. For instances that have a different character limit than the one set by Mastodon, TWBlue will detect the new limit and adjust the dialogs to allow you to use it correctly.
* Most of the TWBlue GUI has been adapted so that the buffers reflect the change of social network (in mastodon, for example, the buttons to write posts say post instead of tweet). However, the menu bar has not yet been updated. This means that most of the options still refer to Twitter, although they can be used with mastodon accounts. For example, if you select the “tweet” menu in the menu bar, and then select the “Retweet” option, TWBlue will actually do a “boost” if the buffer you are in is a Mastodon account buffer.
* Keystrokes for the invisible interface also refer to terms used in Twitter, but can be applied to Mastodon as well.
* There are some features, within TWBlue, that are not yet compatible with mastodon accounts. These are as follows:
    * User autocompletion.
    * Currently, it is not possible to update account settings for mastodon sessions. However, if you know how to edit configuration files, you can close TWBlue, change your session file with any text editor and restart the application to update what you want.
    * The template editor is not yet available for mastodon accounts.
    * Filters have not yet been implemented in TWBlue mastodon support.
    * User aliases are not implemented yet.
    * It is not possible to view a user’s profile, nor edit your own, for now. However, you can use the keystroke to open the item in the browser when focusing a user to access their profile website. This only works in buffers where users are listed.
    * You cannot manage lists in TWBlue at the moment.
* Most of the buffers planned for mastodon should just work. Among those currently tested are: home (main timeline for the logged-in user), Local (public posts for the instance), federated (public posts for all federating instances), mentions, direct messages, sent posts, favorites, bookmarks, followers, following, blocked users, muted users, user searches and timelines for users.
    *  The difference between favorites and bookmarks is that the author of the post can see who has marked his posts as favorites, but bookmarks are completely private. In any buffer containing mastodon posts, except direct messages, the GUI will display an option to add the post to favorites or bookmarks.
    * Direct messages in mastodon are posts, exactly like normal posts, but with their privacy setting set so that they can only be seen by the accounts that are mentioned. In the direct message buffer, a conversation will appear for each item in the buffer. The conversation represents a thread of messages, but TWBlue can only display the last of the messages sent. This is similar to what happens on platforms like Telegram, where you can only see the list of conversations at the beginning. To see the entire thread of direct messages present in a conversation, you can use the command to open the conversation, or go to the “tweet” menu in the menu bar, and then towards the “view conversation” option. This will create a new conversation buffer that will be located just after the direct messages buffer (for the GUI, the buffer will be located just inside the direct messages buffer in the buffer tree). When a private post appears (whose visibility only allows the mentioned accounts to see it), TWBlue will display that post in the home buffer, in mentions and also will update/create the conversation with that item. This is because Mastodon does not differentiate between a private message and a normal post. You can reply to the post in any buffer to continue the conversation. If you reply to any post, the privacy set in the original post is maintained by default, but can also be changed.
    * The buffer showing the federated timeline has been disabled from settings. This is because on servers that federate with many instances it can load many posts in a very short time. To enable this buffer, for now, edit the TWBlue configuration while the application is closed, and add the “federated” buffer in the option called “buffer_order”. As soon as buffers can be shown or hidden, this process can be done through the GUI.
    * There is a Streaming API that allows the elements for the start buffers, mentions, direct messages, sent posts and followers to appear in real time. This feature is implemented by default and should also just work.
    * Timelines for users only allow to get all posts from users who are in the same instance. For users belonging to other instances, you can get the posts that have been downloaded to your instance since your instance “knows” the remote user.
    * Timelines for followers and following can be fully retrieved only for users belonging to the same instance. Remote users may yield unclear results.
    * You can search by users (by opening a search and selecting the “users” radio button). The search can be done by local users, such as twblue, or by remote users, such as @twblue@maaw.social.
* In all buffers, a maximum of 40 items are retrieved per load, but more can be retrieved by using the option to load more items in the buffer.
* In post buffers, you can do most of the actions already supported in TWBlue (boost, add/remove from favorites or bookmarks, reply, send message to user, open post URL, play audio or video, open post on web, view conversation, open action dialog for user).
* In user buffers, you can send private message to the user, and open user actions dialog, which in turn allows you to follow/unfollow, block/unblock and mute/unmute.
* When writing posts, it is possible to attach up to 4 images, 4 givs, or even a video, poll, or audio. It is also possible to add the “sensitive content” tag to posts, change privacy and write a content warning text. It is possible to create threads using the “add post” button.
* When replying to a post, TWBlue will place the username of all participants in the item you reply to. The privacy options will default to those of the original post.

## Changes in version 2022.8.28

* the user autocompletion feature has been completely rewritten to be easier to use, particularly for people with many followers/following users:
    * In the account settings dialog, there's a button that opens up a new dialog that allows you to "scan" your account in order to add all users from your followers/following list. This process will read your data directly from Twitter and depending in the amount of people you have in your account it might take too many API calls. Please use it with caution. You can, for example, do the process separately for your followers/following people so it will be easier to handle, in case you have a massive amount of people. If TWBlue is unable to complete the scan, you will see an error and will be prompted to try again in 15 minutes, once your API calls have refreshed.
    * It is possible to use the user autocompletion functionality in dialogs where you can select an user, for example when adding or removing someone from a list, or displaying lists for someone.
* Implemented a new setting, available in the account settings dialog, that allows to hide emojis in twitter usernames.
* TWBlue should be able to sort conversations in a more logical way. This should make it easier to follow a long thread in Twitter.
* When opening a thread, TWBlue should be able to load the right conversation if the original tweet from where the thread was loaded was a retweet.
* TWBlue will restart the Streaming subsystem every time there are changes to followed, muted or blocked users within the application.
* Fixed error when attempting to mention an user by using the "mention" button in any people buffer. Now tweets should be posted normally.
* Fixed error when loading other user lists. ([#465](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/issues/465))
* Fixed an issue that was making TWBlue to display incorrectly some retweets of quoted tweets.
* If TWBlue is unable to open a timeline for someone who has blocked you, this will be reported in a dialog. ([#485,](https://github.com/mcv-software/twblue/issues/485))
* Added "find a string in the currently focused buffer" action into Windows 10 and windows 11 keymap. ([#476](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/476))

## changes in version 22.2.23

* We have added Experimental support for templates in the invisible interface. The GUI will remain unchanged for now:
    * Each object (tweet, received direct message, sent direct message and people) has its own template in the settings. You can edit those templates from the account settings dialog, in the new "templates" tab.
    * Every template is composed of the group of variables you want to display for each object. Each variable will start with a dollar sign ($) and cannot contain spaces or special characters. Templates can include arbitrary text that will not be processed. When editing the example templates, you can get an idea of the variables that are available for each object by using the template editing dialog. When you press enter on a variable from the list of available variables, it will be added to the template automatically. When you try to save a template, TWBlue will warn you if the template is incorrectly formatted or if it includes variables that do not exist in the information provided by objects. It is also possible to return to default values from the same dialog when editing a template.
    * TWBlue can display image descriptions within Tweet templates. For that, you can use the $image_description variable in your template.
* We have restored conversation and threads support powered by Twitter API V2 thanks to a set of improvements we have done in the application, as well as more generous limits to Tweet monthly cap by Twitter.
* In the Windows 11 Keymap, the default shortcut to open the keystrokes editor is now CTRL+Alt+Windows+K to avoid conflicts with the new global mute microphone shortcut.
* TWBlue show display properly HTML entities in tweet's text.
* TWBlue should no longer load old tweets in buffers.
* Fixed issue when uploading attachments (images, videos or gif files) while sending tweets or replies.
* Fixed an error that was making TWBlue to ask for a restart after saving account settings, even if such restart was not required. ([#413,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/413))

## Changes in version 2021.11.12

* Now it is possible to create a tweet from a trending topics buffer again.
* TWBlue now includes a completely new set of dialogs to handle tweeting, replying and sending direct messages that takes advantage of more Twitter features.
    * It is possible to add videos in tweets and direct messages by using the new "add" button, located in every dialog where  media can be added. Twitter suggests to add videos from 5 seconds up to 2 minutes lenght, in mp4 format (video Codec H.264 and audio codec AAC). Currently, TWBlue does not check if the uploaded video complies with Twitter media requirements. You can add only a video in a tweet or direct message. No other kind of media can be added after a video is in a tweet. If the video was unable to be uploaded successfully, the tweet or direct message won't be created.
    * Now you can add a poll to tweets. Polls can have up to 4 different options and allow voting up to 7 days after being created. Take into account, though, that currently TWBlue does not support reading polls in tweets.
    * TWBlue now support threads while creating a new tweet. There is a new button, called add tweet which will add the current tweet to the thread and will allow you to write another tweet in the thread. Every tweet might include media (up to 4 photos, or one GIF image or a video) or up to one poll.
    * Some functionality was removed from tweet dialogs within TWBlue. Particularly, URL shorteners and long tweets via Twishort. You still can read long tweets posted via Twishort, though.

## Changes in version 2021.11.07

* TWBlue should retrieve tweets from threads and conversations in a more reliable way. Tweets in the same thread (made by the same author) will be sorted correctly, although replies to the thread (made by different people) may not be ordered in the same way they are displayed in Twitter apps. ([#417](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/417))
* When creating a filter, TWBlue will show an error if user has not provided a name for the filter. Before, unnamed filters were a cause of config breaks in the application.
* It is again possible to read the changelog for TWBlue from the help menu in the menu bar.
* fixed a bug when clearing the direct messages buffer. ([#418](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/418))
* fixed an issue that was making TWBlue to show incorrectly titles for trending topic buffers upon startup. ([#421](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/421))
* fixed an issue that was making users of the graphical user interface to delete a buffer if a trends buffer was opened in the same session.
* Updated Spanish, Japanese and french translations.

## Changes in Version 2021.10.30

* Fixed many errors in the way we compile TWBlue, so users of 64 bits systems and particularly windows 7 users would be able to install TWBlue again. In case of issues with versions prior to 2021.10.30, please remove everything related to TWBlue (except configs) and reinstall the version 2021.10.30 to fix any possible error. This step won't be needed again in 23 months. ([#416,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/416), [#415,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/415))
* fixed an issue that was making impossible to manually add an user to the autocomplete users database.
* Started to improve support to conversations by searching for conversation_id.

## changes in version 2021.10.27

* Added an user alias manager, located in the application menu in the menu bar. From this dialog, it is possible to review, add, edit or remove user aliases for the current account. ([#401](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/401))
* TWBlue now closes the VLC player window automatically when a video reaches its end. ([#399](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/399))
* After a lot of time, TWBlue now uses a new default Soundpack, called FreakyBlue. This soundpack will be set by default in all new sessions created in the application. Thanks to [Andre Louis](https://twitter.com/FreakyFwoof) for the pack. ([#247](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/247))
* When reading a tweet, if the tweet contains more than 2 consecutive mentions, TWBlue will announce how many more users the tweet includes, as opposed to read every user in the conversation. You still can display the tweet to read all users.
* In the tweet displayer, It is possible to copy a link to the current tweet or person by pressing a button called "copy link to clipboard".
* Added a keymap capable to work under Windows 11. ([#391](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/391))
* Added user aliases to TWBlue. This feature allows you to rename user's display names on Twitter, so the next time you'll read an user it will be announced as you configured. For adding an alias to an user, select the "add alias" option in the user menu, located in the menu bar. This feature works only if you have set display screen names unchecked. Users are displayed with their display name in people buffers only. This action is supported in all keymaps, although it is undefined by default. ([#389](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/389))
* There are some changes to the autocomplete users feature:
    * Now users can search for twitter screen names or display names in the database.
* It is possible to undefine keystrokes in the current keymap in TWBlue. This allows you, for example, to redefine keystrokes completely.
* We have changed our Geocoding service to the Nominatim API from OpenStreetMap. Addresses present in tweets are going to be determined by this service, as the Google Maps API now requires an API key. ([#390](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/390))
* Added a limited version of the Twitter's Streaming API: The Streaming API will work only for tweets, and will receive tweets only by people you follow. Protected users are not possible to be streamed. It is possible that during high tweet traffic, the Stream might get disconnected at times, but TWBlue should be capable of detecting this problem and reconnecting the stream again. ([#385](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/385))
* Fixed an issue that made TWBlue to not show a dialog when attempting to show a profile for a suspended user. ([#387](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/387))
* Added support for Twitter audio and videos: Tweets which contains audio or videos will be detected as audio items, and you can playback those with the regular command to play audios. ([#384,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/384))
* We just implemented some changes in the way TWBlue handles tweets in order to reduce its RAM memory usage [#380](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/380):
    * We reduced the tweets size by storing only the tweet fields we currently use. This should reduce tweet's size in memory for every object up to 75%.
    * When using the cache database to store your tweets, there is a new setting present in the account settings dialog, in the general tab. This setting allows you to control whether TWBlue will load the whole database into memory (which is the current behaviour) or not.
        * Loading the whole database into memory has the advantage of being extremely fast to access any element (for example when moving through tweets in a buffer), but it requires more memory as the tweet buffers grow up. This should, however, use less memory than before thanks to the optimizations performed in tweet objects. If you have a machine with enough memory, this should be a good option for your case.
        * If you uncheck this setting, TWBlue will read the whole database from disk. This is significantly slower, but the advantage of this setting is that it will consume almost no extra memory, no matter how big is the tweets dataset. Be ware, though, that TWBlue might start to feel slower when accessing elements (for example when reading tweets) as the buffers grow up. This setting is suggested for computers with low memory or for those people not wanting to keep a really big amount of tweets stored.
* Changed the label in the direct message's text control so it will indicate that the user needs to write the text there, without referring to any username in particular. ([#366,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/366))
* TWBlue will take Shift+F10 again as the contextual menu key in the list of items in a buffer. This stopped working after we have migrated to WX 4.1. ([#353,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/353))
* TWBlue should render correctly retweets of quoted tweets. ([#365,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/365))
* Fixed an error that was causing TWBlue to be unable to output to screen readers at times. ([#369,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/369))
* Fixed autocomplete users feature. ([#367,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/367))
* Fixed error when displaying an URL at the end of a line, when the tweet or direct message contained multiple lines. Now the URL should be displayed correctly. ([#305,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/305) [#272,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/272))
* TWBlue has been migrated completely to Python 3 (currently, the software builds with Python 3.8).
* TWBlue should be restarted gracefully. Before, the application was alerting users of not being closed properly every time the application restarted by itself.
* If TWBlue attemps to load an account with invalid tokens (this happens when reactivating a previously deactivated account, or when access to the ap is revoqued), TWBlue will inform the user about this error and will skip the account. Before, the app was unable to start due to a critical error. ([#328,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/328))
* When sending a direct message, the title of the window will change appropiately when the recipient is edited. ([#276,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/276))
* URL'S in user profiles are expanded automatically. ([#275,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/275))
* TWBlue now uses [Tweepy,](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to connect with Twitter. We have adopted this change in order to support Twitter'S API V 2 in the very near future. ([#333,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/337) [#347](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/347))
* TWBlue can upload images in Tweets and replies again. ([#240,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/240))
* Fixed the way we use to count characters in Twitter. The new methods in TWBlue take into account special characters and URLS as documented in Twitter. ([#199,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/199) [#315](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/315))
* Proxy support now works as expected.
* Changed translation service from yandex.translate to Google Translator. ([#355,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/355))
* Improved method to load direct messages in the buffers. Now it should be faster due to less calls to Twitter API performed from the client.
* And more. ([#352,](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/352))

## Changes in version 0.95

* TWBlue can open a Tweet or user directly in Twitter. There is a new option in the context menu for people and tweet buffers, and also, the shortcut control+win+alt+Enter will open the focused item in Twitter.

* The volume slider, located in the account settings of TWBlue, now should decrease and increase value properly when up and down arrows are pressed. Before it was doing it in inverted order. ([#261](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/261))
* autoreading has been redesigned to work in a similar way for almost all buffers. Needs testing. ([#221](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/221))

* There is a new soundpack, called FreakyBlue (Thanks to [Andre Louis](https://twitter.com/FreakyFwoof)) as a new option in TWBlue. This pack can be the default in the next stable, so users can take a look and share their opinion in snapshot versions. ([#247](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/247))
* There is a new option in the help menu that allows you to visit the soundpacks section in the TWBlue website. ([#247](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/247))
* When reading location of a geotagged tweet, it will be translated for users of other languages. ([#251](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/pull/251))
* When there are no more items to retrieve in direct messages and people buffers, a message will announce it.
* Fixed an issue reported by some users that was making them unable to load more items in their direct messages.
* It is possible to add a tweet to the likes buffer from the menu bar again.
* Tweets, replies and retweets will be added to sent tweets right after being posted in Twitter.
* Extended Tweets should be displayed properly in list buffers.

## Changes in version 0.94

* Added an option in the global settings dialog to disable the Streaming features of TWBlue. TWBlue will remove all Streaming features after August 16, so this option will give people an idea about how it will be. ([#219](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/219))
* Due to Twitter API changes, Switched authorisation method to Pin-code based authorisation. When you add new accounts to TWBlue, you will be required to paste a code displayed in the Twitter website in order to grant access to TWBlue. ([#216](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/216))
* In order to comply with latest Twitter changes, TWBlue has switched to the new method used to send and receive direct messages, according to issue [#215.](https://github.com/manuelcortez/twblue/issues/215)
    * The new method does not allow direct messages to be processed in real time. Direct messages will be updated periodically.
* After august 16 or when streaming is disabled, the events buffer will no longer be created in TWBlue.
* You can configure frequency for buffer updates in TWBlue. By default, TWBlue will update all buffers every 2 minutes, but you can change this setting in the global settings dialog. ([#223](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/223))
* Added a new tab called feedback, in the account settings dialog. This tab allows you to control whether automatic speech or Braille feedbak in certain events (mentions and direct messages received) is enabled. Take into account that this option will take preference over automatic reading of buffers and any kind of automatic output. ([#203](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/203))
* The spell checking dialog now has access keys defined for the most important actions. ([#211](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/211))
* TWBlue now Uses WXPython 4.0.1. This will allow us to migrate all important components to Python 3 in the future. ([#207](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/207))
* When you quote a Tweet, if the original tweet was posted with Twishort, TWBlue should display properly the quoted tweet. Before it was displaying the original tweet only. ([#206](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/206))

    * for opening a trends buffer, press control+Windows+T
* TWBlue has received improvements in some functions for handling extended tweets, long tweets and quoted retweets. It should render some tweets in a better way.
* In the spell checker module, there is a new button that will allow you to add your own words to your personal dictionary so the module won't mark them as mispelled the next time you will check spelling.
* Added filtering capabilities to TWBlue. ([#102](https://github.com/manuelcortez/TWBlue/issues/102))
